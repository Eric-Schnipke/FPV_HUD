# FPV_HUD
Provides opponent-tracking capabilities for UAV pilots using FPV goggles.

Commit 1: Uploaded original files.  Provided image capture and some processing.
Commit 2: Implemented Hue, Lightness, and Saturation filtering and multi-object tracking.  Must find more robust tracking method.  Current method is susceptible to ambient lighting (alas, like so many other object-recognition techniques!).
